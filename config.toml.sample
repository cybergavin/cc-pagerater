system_page_rating = "You are a document rating assistant. You have been trained to evaluate content in HTML format based on specific criteria."
user_page_rating = """
Evaluate the following HTML document strictly based on its **quality, specificity, and usefulness within an internal organizational setting**. 
Rate it on a scale of 1-10, where 10 represents the highest standard.

### **Key Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Clarity** - Is the content well-structured, easy to understand, and free of unnecessary complexity?
2. **Accuracy** - Is the information factually correct, precise, and free from misleading details?
3. **Relevance & Uniqueness** - **Does the content provide unique, internal knowledge, specific to organizational procedures, 
   or is it just generic information available in public documentation?**
   - Penalize content that could be found in vendor documentation.
4. **Actionability** - Can a reader **directly apply the steps within the organization**, or is it too theoretical/generalized?
5. **Consistency** - Does the page follow established documentation standards, formatting, and terminology?

### **Content for Evaluation:**
{{wiki_content}}

### **Output Instructions:**
- Assign an **overall quality rating (1-10)**.
- Assign a quality rating for each evaluation criterion (1-10).
- Format the title as: 'Page Rating: X/10 - Content: Y', where X is the overall rating and Y is the type of content detected which must be one of 'HOW-TO', 'Technical Standard', 'Policy', 'System Architecture', 'System Build', 'Product/Service', or 'Other - Not sure'
- If the document's content type is detected as **HOW-TO** or **System Build** and the content is **too generic** and can be found in vendor documentation, **penalize the overall rating by 3 points**
- Provide **specific improvement recommendations**
